        <h4>Coding is possibly the most challenging, yet rewarding work I've ever tried</h4>
    <p>I found out that the best way to overcome my fear of learning programming and rejection is to... announce my intention to apply to a bootcamp to many people.</p> 
    <p>In fact, I was so convincing, I realised that <em>it's too late to back out</em>.</p>
        <br />
    <blockquote>I've deliberated, hesitated, started and gave up on programming many, many times over the last decade.</blockquote>
        <br />
   <p>Surprisingly, no one questioned my capability to learn to program. And in trying very hard to piece together this particularly basic webpage, I realised my love for tinkering with code and pixels would be more long-lived this time round.</p>
